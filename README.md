- ðŸ¤” Hi! I am a backend developer. I really like dealing with complex systems, resources, and servers...
- ðŸŒ± I mainly work with languages such as Python, Rust, and JavaScript.
- âš¡ In my free time, I work on my blockchain project. At the moment, I am accumulating the strength invested in this project. This activity satisfies my "technical creativity".
