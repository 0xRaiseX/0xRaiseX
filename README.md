# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Backend developer âœ¨
### Python and Rust developer

### I can think and get results 

- I really like dealing with complex systems, resources, and servers...
- I mainly work with languages such as Python, Rust, and JavaScript.
- In my free time, I work on my blockchain project. At the moment, I am accumulating the strength invested in this project. This activity satisfies my "technical creativity".
